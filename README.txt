### README

This directory includes r code for simulating least cost paths across landscapes where there are two substrates with two separate costs. \

The model folder contains an r script for training the model, and an r script for plotting the data implied by the posterior distributions. \

The simulation folder contains a folder with the functions employed in the simulation, and the simulation r code. \

The simulation produces a CSV file, which you should copy into the data directory of the model script when you have a parameterized simulation you are interested in studying. \
